 In this section, I'll be sharing my educational journey with you. I attended SRVS National Higher Secondary School, where I pursued schooling. It was an enriching experience that taught me a lot about basic education and life. In 10th grade, I scored 491 out of 500, and I scored 577 out of 600 in 12th grade. After completing my higher secondary education, I have written some entrance exams, which include the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test), JEE Mains (Joint Entrance Examination), and JEE Advanced. I scored 92.37 percentile in JEE Mains and a decent score of 349 out of 720 in NEET. Currently, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at SASTRA University.

         As I reflect on my accomplishments, I am proud of the achievements I have made throughout my life. One significant achievement that stands out to me is securing the state-level first place in a painting competition conducted by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency and representing my state in the national-level competition. This milestone required countless hours of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, including late nights working and overcoming challenging coursework. I am proud of my academic achievements, as they represent my commitment to learning and personal growth. In addition, I have won district-level first place in chess, badminton, and various sports events.

I have a great interest in the fields of space science, painting, and problem-solving. I feel that space science is a vast and very interesting field to learn about. Though I'm already into art, I would like to develop my knowledge in different fields of art. Exploring and engaging with areas of interest can provide enjoyment, personal growth, and learning opportunities. It is important to pursue and develop these areas to cultivate a fulfilling and well-rounded life. I love solving problems in real life, which gives us new experiences.
